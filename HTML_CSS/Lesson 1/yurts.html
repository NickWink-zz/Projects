<h2> The Yurts at Pacific Trails Resort </h2>

<b> What is a yurt? </b>

	<p> Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.  </p>
	
<b> How are the yurts furnished? </b>

	<p> Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fi red stove. The luxury camping experience also includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge. </p>
	
<b> What should I bring? </b>

	<p> Bring a sense of adventure and some time to relax! Most guests also pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with layers of clothing. </p>
